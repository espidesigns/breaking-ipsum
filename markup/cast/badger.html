<p>Ever tell you about my Star Trek script? Yeah! I gotta write it down is all. The Enterprise is five parsecs out of Rigel XII. Nothing's going on, Neutral Zone is quiet, the crew is bored, so they put on a pie-eating contest. The whole crew's in the galley. They're eating tulaberry pies– Tulaberries. From Gamma Quadrant, yo. Okay, blueberries then, and they're eating blueberry pies...as fast as the replicator can churn 'em out. [imitates replicator noise.] Burdalurdalurp-pssst! Burdalurdalurp-pssst! Finally, it's down to just three: Kirk, Spock, and Chekov. Okay, Spock always wins these things. Spock has total Vulcan control over his digestion! </p>

<p>You wanna hear this or not? Okay, finally – Kirk, he can't take it anymore. He yorks. Now it's just down to Chekov and Spock. But Chekov, y'see, he's got a whole fat stack of quatloos riding on this. And he has figured out a way to win. He's got Scotty back in the transporter room locked in on Chekov's stomach. Every time Chekov eats a pie, Scotty beams it right out of him. Space. There's blueberries just floating out there frozen – because it's in space – and Chekov is just shoveling them into his mouth, and–and Spock is like, "I can't believe this Russian is defeating me!" Meanwhile, Scotty's in the transporter room fiddling with levers when Lieutenant Uhura comes in and she's got, like, her big pointies, and Scotty's fingers are all sweaty. Chekov screams, he sprays blood out of his mouth ...Scotty beamed his guts into space!</p>

<p>No, no, no, man, Resident Evil 4 takes it by a long shot. No, man, seriously, that chick? The one you gotta rescue? She's smoking, bro. And then you're like the last undead dude on Earth, so how can you not be dipping into that? Talk about inspiring a brother to kick some zombie ass.</p>

  <li>Because I'm on probation, yo. Gotta prove to the man I'm rehabilitated.</li>
  <li>I sold a teenth.</li>
  <li>You know, I don't exactly know how to feel about all this.</li>

<p>Dude, you are so historically retarded! Nazi zombies don't wanna eat ya just 'cause they're craving the protein. They do it 'cause, they do it 'cause they hate Americans, man. Talibans. They're the Talibans of the zombie world.</p>

<p>Dude, that's 'cause they're not even zombies! They're just infected! They got like this rage virus. Amps 'em up like they've been smoking the schwag! Apples and oranges, bro. Not even fair to compare the two.</p>
